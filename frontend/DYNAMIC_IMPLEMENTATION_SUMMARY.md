- User-specific data loading (profile, bookings)
- Provider-specific data loading
- Orchestrated initialization sequence
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### Booking Management (`utils/bookingHelpers.js`)
- Comprehensive booking status handling
- Booking creation, updating, and cancellation
- Smart action validation (can cancel, reschedule, review)

- Booking statistics calculation
- Confirmation dialogs and notifications

#### Request Throttling (`utils/requestThrottler.js`)
- Already implemented with sophisticated throttling
- Prevents 429 rate limit errors
- Request caching and retry logic
- Queue management and staggered execution

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Safe String Rendering**: Prevents React render errors from invalid data
- **Fallback Data**: Graceful degradation when API data is unavailable
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data fetching
- **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms and user-friendly error messages
- **Null Safety**: Comprehensive null checking throughout components

### 5. **User Experience Improvements**
- **Intelligent Interactions**: Buttons disabled when actions aren't available
- **Real-time Updates**: Data refresh on focus and pull-to-refresh
- **Contextual Navigation**: Parameters passed between screens
- **Notification System**: User feedback for all major actions
- **Progressive Loading**: Staggered data loading to improve perceived performance

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Redux Store Structure
```
store/
â”œâ”€â”€ slices/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ authSlice.js      âœ… Authentication & user session
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bookingSlice.js   âœ… Booking management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ servicesSlice.js  âœ… Service catalog & search
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ userSlice.js      âœ… User profile management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ appSlice.js       âœ… App state & notifications
```

### API Integration
- **Throttled Requests**: Prevents rate limiting
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff  
- **Caching**: Request caching to reduce API calls
- **Fallback Data**: Mock data when APIs are unavailable

### Component Architecture
- **Screen Components**: Main UI screens with Redux integration
- **Utility Functions**: Reusable business logic and helpers
- **Navigation**: Parameter passing and deep linking support

## ðŸš€ Key Features Implemented

### Authentication Flow
- âœ… Token-based authentication with AsyncStorage
- âœ… Automatic session restore on app launch
- âœ… Role-based navigation (customer/provider)
- âœ… Secure logout with complete cleanup

### Booking Management
- âœ… Create, view, update, cancel bookings
- âœ… Status-based filtering and display
- âœ… Time-based action validation
- âœ… Review system integration
- âœ… Real-time status updates

### Service Discovery
- âœ… Browse services by category
- âœ… Search with real-time results
- âœ… Service details and provider info
- âœ… Booking initiation from services

### Profile Management
- âœ… View and update user profiles
- âœ… Avatar and contact information
- âœ… Booking history and statistics
- âœ… Notification preferences

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Enhancements
