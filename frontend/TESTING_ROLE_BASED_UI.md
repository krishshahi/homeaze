# 🧪 Testing Role-Based UI Guide

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Navigation Now Routes by User Type

The issue was in `App.js` - it was always routing authenticated users to `MainNavigator` (customer interface) instead of checking the user type.

### 🔧 What Was Fixed:
1. **App.js Navigation Logic**: Now checks `user.userType` and routes correctly
2. **Initial Route**: Properly sets initial route based on user type
3. **Role-Based Routing**: Providers → `ProviderNavigator`, Customers → `MainNavigator`

## 🧪 How to Test the Different Interfaces

### 👨‍🔧 Testing Provider Interface

1. **Login as Provider:**
   - Email: `provider@example.com`
   - Password: `Password123!`

2. **What You'll See:**
   - **Provider Navigation**: Dashboard, Bookings, Services, Profile
   - **Provider Dashboard**: Business analytics, earnings, booking requests
   - **Provider Services**: Manage YOUR OWN services with **"+ Add Service"** button
   - **Provider Bookings**: Handle customer booking requests

3. **Create Service Feature:**
   - Go to **Services** tab
   - Tap the **blue "+" button** in the header (top-right)
   - You'll see the `EnhancedProviderServiceCreateScreen` with 3-step form
   - Categories: Cleaning, Maintenance, Landscaping, etc.
   - Features: Pricing, availability, features, cancellation policy

### 👤 Testing Customer Interface

1. **Login as Customer:**
   - Email: `customer@example.com`
   - Password: `Password123!`

2. **What You'll See:**
   - **Customer Navigation**: Home, Services, Bookings, Profile
   - **Home**: Browse featured services, quick actions
   - **Services**: Browse ALL services from ALL providers (marketplace)
   - **Bookings**: Track YOUR booking requests and status
