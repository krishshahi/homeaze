# Profile Management Features

## Overview
I have enhanced the profile screen to be fully dynamic with backend connectivity and image upload functionality.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Dynamic ProfileScreen
- **Location**: `src/screens/customer/ProfileScreen.js`
- **Features**:
  - Displays user data dynamically from Redux store
  - Shows user stats (total bookings, completed bookings, average rating)
  - Navigation to edit profile screen
  - Logout functionality with confirmation
  - Responsive loading states

### ✅ Enhanced EditProfileScreen
- **Location**: `src/screens/EditProfileScreen.js`
- **Features**:
  - Full backend integration with Redux
  - Form validation with error handling
  - Profile picture upload with camera/gallery options
  - Nested address field handling
  - Real-time form updates
  - Loading states and error handling

### ✅ Image Upload Functionality
- **Dependencies**: `expo-image-picker` (installed)
- **Features**:
  - Take photo with camera
  - Choose from photo library
  - Image editing with 1:1 aspect ratio
  - Automatic upload to backend
  - Permission handling for camera and gallery
  - Cross-platform support (iOS/Android)

### ✅ Backend Integration
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /users/profile` - Fetch user profile
  - `PUT /users/profile` - Update user profile
  - `POST /users/upload-avatar` - Upload profile picture
- **Redux Integration**:
  - Uses existing `userSlice` with actions:
    - `fetchProfile` - Load user data
    - `updateProfile` - Save profile changes  
    - `uploadAvatarThunk` - Upload profile picture

## Data Structure

### Profile Data Format
```javascript
{
  name: "John Doe",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe", 
  email: "john@example.com",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  bio: "User bio text",
  avatar: "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown", 
    state: "CA",
    zipCode: "12345"
  }
}
```

## Navigation Structure
- **ProfileScreen** → **EditProfile** (from "Edit Profile" menu item)
- **ProfileStack** in `CustomerNavigator.js` includes both screens
- Proper back navigation and navigation reset on successful updates

## Form Validation
- Required fields: firstName, lastName, email, phone
- Email format validation
- Real-time error clearing on field changes
- Visual error indicators with red borders

## User Experience
- **Loading States**: Spinners during API calls
- **Success/Error Feedback**: Alert dialogs for user feedback
- **Permission Handling**: Graceful handling of camera/gallery permissions
- **Responsive Design**: Proper keyboard handling and scrolling
- **Accessibility**: Icons and labels for screen readers

## Usage
1. Navigate to Profile tab in the app
2. View your profile information and stats
3. Tap "Edit Profile" to make changes
4. Tap camera icon to update profile picture
5. Fill in your information and tap "Save Changes"
6. Changes are saved to backend and reflected immediately

## Dependencies
- `expo-image-picker`: For camera and gallery functionality
- `@expo/vector-icons`: For UI icons
- `react-redux`: For state management
- Existing API and Redux infrastructure

## Files Modified/Created
- ✅ Created: `src/screens/customer/ProfileScreen.js`
- ✅ Enhanced: `src/screens/EditProfileScreen.js`
- ✅ Updated: `src/navigation/CustomerNavigator.js`

The profile functionality is now fully dynamic, connected to the backend, and includes professional image upload capabilities!
